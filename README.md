Here's the TL;DR:

- Author identification is a task of increasing relevance in machine learning.
- Algorithms have been developed to identify the authors in other contexts, e.g. literary texts, news articles, and tweets.
- Project aim: *identify the rapper of a song based only on lyrics, from a given set of rappers.*
- Parameters of the resulting model can be used to explore characteristics of rap lyrics, e.g. uniqueness of vocabulary or recurring lyrical themes.
