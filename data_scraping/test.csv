Jay Z|4:44|"  [Intro: Hannah Williams] Do I find it so hard When I know in my heart I'm letting you down every day Letting you down every day Why do I keep on running away?  [Verse 1: JAY-Z] Look, I apologize, often womanize Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you I harassed you out in Paris ""Please come back to Rome,"" you make it home We talked for hours when you were on tour “Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!” I said: “Don't embarrass me,” instead of “Be mine” That was my proposal for us to go steady That was your 21st birthday You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready So I apologize I seen the innocence leave your eyes I still mourn this death and I apologize for all the stillborns cause I wasn't present Your body wouldn't accept it I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions 'Cause I was emotionless And I apologize 'cause at your best you are love And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed And you stare blankly into space Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit So I apologize  [Chorus: Hannah Williams] I'm never gonna treat you I'm never gonna treat you like I should Ohhhhhh  [Verse 2: JAY-Z] I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions Or sleep with our back turned We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops And then meet in a space where the dark stop And let love light the way Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face I never wanted another woman to know Something about me that you didn't know I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold I suck at love, I think I need a do-over I will be emotionally available if I invited you over I stew over, what if you over my shit?  [Chorus: Hannah Williams] I'm never gonna treat you I'm never gonna treat you like I should Ohhhhhh  [Verse 3: JAY-Z] And if my children knew I don't even know what I would do If they ain't look at me the same I would prob'ly die with all the shame ""You did what with who?"" What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate? ""You risked that for Blue?"" If I wasn't a superhero in your face My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes And the mask goes away And Santa Claus is fake And you go online and see For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay  [Chorus: Hannah Williams] I'm never gonna treat you like I should  "

Eminem|Love Game|"  [Produced by Rick Rubin]  [Verse 1: Eminem] Something's burning, I can't figure out what (out what) It's either lust or a cloud of dust Judgement is clouded; must Just be the powder from the power of (love) But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of Left my girl in the house alone Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan? And the further I walk, the louder Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard ‘Cause after all, this is her place So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I Think I might be about to bust her, bust her The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts – brace Hope it ain't, ""Here we go, yo!"" ‘Cause my head already goes to worst-case Scenario, though in the first place But you confirmed my low end theory though Shoulda known when I made it all the way to third base And that was only the first date Coulda made it to home plate But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first ""No (slurp) you don't (slurp) under (slurp) stand I (slurp) don't (slurp) do this for anyone ever."" Yeah, that ain't what they all say I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw Used to be my fiancé 'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e Polow Tha Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh? ‘Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin' But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray But I'll probably always keep on playin'—  [Bridge: Sample] The game of love, love, love, love La-la-la-la-la love  [Hook: Kendrick Lamar] She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door She screamed she loved me like she never did before And I told her: (Go where you wanna go! Go do whatcha want to do – I don't care!) And I told her: (Go where you wanna go! Go do whatcha want to do – I don't care!)  [Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar] I told that bitch I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick Suckin' dick in your momma tub, then your granny walked in Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water He drowned, like an abortion They booked you for manslaughter You beat the case and I called ya ""Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris Wheel Fuckin' spinnin' on me – fuck you think, we gon' get married still? Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fuckin' feel Like you should fuckin' beat it Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period Now have a blessed day."" Bitch, you serious? I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as a Caesarean You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem That's analogy and metaphor for you I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin' That ain't what you like, ain't it? What about if I was as famous as Marshall? Would you give fellatio in the carpool? Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle Singing, ""I hope she's good enough"" Meanwhile you're chasin' her Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the—  [Bridge: Sample] The game of love, love, love, love La-la-la-la-la love  [Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Eminem] She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door She screamed she loved me like she never did before And I told her: (Go where you wanna go! Go do whatcha want to do – I don't care!) And I told her: (Go where you wanna go! Go do whatcha want to do – I don't care!)  [Verse 3: Eminem] So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed Snatch my house key off her key chain She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater Here goes that broken record cliché It's all my fault anyway, she's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ Each day is an Instant Replay They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior Back together but forgot today was her b-day She cut me off on the freeway Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline Stepped on them fuckers eight times Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit comin' up What the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her? Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goddamn halt Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed She's racing at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh? Snatch the bitch out her car through the window She screamin', I body slam her on the cement Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole Buried this stink ho in it, then pay to have the street repaved (The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's laying next to me in bed – directly aiming a gat at my head Woke up again and jumped up Like, ""Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab."" I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch! Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events I said, ""Hit the road"" and after she left I sent that bitch a text, I said, ""Be careful driving Don't read this and have an accident"" She glanced to look at it and wrecked Too bad, thought we had a connect No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling While the whore was yelling, ""Rape!"" 'Til her vocal cords were swelling And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face Still they swarm the gates and my fancy estates To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great But wait, think there's been a mistake You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate I have infinite hate in my blood It's mainly because of the game of— (*Message sound*) ""Wait, dinner at eight?"", I have infinite hate in my blood It's mainly because of the game of—  [Outro] Love, love, love, love L-l, l-l-l-love  "
