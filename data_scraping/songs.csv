Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger Finally pulled it back and saw Three bullets caught up in the chamber So now I'm jettin' to the building lobby And it was full of children prob'ly, couldn't see as high as I be (So what you sayin'?)

You ain't got none You know Jay'll never put your album out without none And, dog, you know how come Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcome They don't know, they just study the charts Me, I studied the shows, the fans, study they hearts I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out Friday Night Lights blew, that was classic number two Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true Still no release date from the label—are they insane? Gucc told me play the game to change the game  [Hook] But on the way I let Nas down I got no one to blame I'm a shame, I let Nas down But this is God's plan, you can never understand, fuck it  [Refrain] Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals 'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin  [Verse 3] I always believed in the bigger picture If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core Then I can open up doors Reintroduce them to honesty, show 'em that they need more The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars, and so, I took the fall Like the son of the Lord on the cross Dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought For the past decade If I should pass, please let this be my last essay Therefore I write from the heart Apologies to OG's for sacrificin' my art But I'm here for a greater purpose I knew right from the start I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead I went to Hell to resurrect it How could you fail to respect it?  [Hook] Letting Nas down, I got the phone call Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down Yeah, and on this flight May I never lose sight, fuck it  [Refrain] Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals 'Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin  "

Can you make peace? can you fight war? Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh Can you survive? Against all odds, now?

2Pac|Keep Ya Head Up|  [Intro] Little something for my godson Elijah And a little girl named Corin  [Verse 1] Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots I give a holla to my sisters on welfare 2Pac cares if don't nobody else care And I know they like to beat you down a lot When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him ‘Cause, sister, you don't need him And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em You know what makes me unhappy? When brothers make babies And leave a young mother to be a pappy And since we all came from a woman Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman I wonder why we take from our women Why we rape our women — do we hate our women? I think it's time to kill for our women Time to heal our women, be real to our women And if we don't we'll have a race of babies That will hate the ladies that make the babies And since a man can't make one He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one So will the real men get up? I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up  [Hook] Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter  [Verse 2] Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough And though we had it rough, we always had enough I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two And I realize Mama really paid the price She nearly gave her life to raise me right And all I had to give her was my pipe dream Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind Last night my buddy lost his whole family It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity It seems the rain'll never let up I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours They got money for wars but can't feed the poor Say there ain't no hope for the youth And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future And then they wonder why we crazy I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up  [Hook] Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter  [Verse 3] And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em ‘Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more ‘Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo' You can't complain you was dealt this Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless Because there's too many things for you to deal with Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless While tears is rollin' down your cheeks You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week ‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it And don't blame me — I was given this world, I didn't make it And now my son's gettin' older and older And colder from havin' the world on his shoulders While the rich kids is drivin' Benz I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up But please, you got to keep ya head up

2Pac|Changes|"  [Verse 1: 2Pac] I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself? I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch Cops give a damn about a negro Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero ""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the welfare!"" First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other ""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead I got love for my brother But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other We gotta start makin' changes Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers And that's how it's supposed to be How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? I'd love to go back to when we played as kids But things change… and that's the way it is  [Hook: Talent] That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah  [Verse 2: 2Pac] I see no changes, all I see is racist faces Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races We under, I wonder what it takes to make this One better place, let's erase the wasted Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right ‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight And the only time we chill is when we kill each other It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other And although it seems heaven-sent We ain't ready to see a black president It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks But some things will never change Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game Now tell me, what's a mother to do? Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you You gotta operate the easy way ""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way Sellin' crack to the kids ""I gotta get paid!"" — well hey, but that's the way it is  [Hook: Talent] That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah  [Interlude: 2Pac] We gotta make a change It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes Let's change the way we eat Let's change the way we live And let's change the way we treat each other You see the old way wasn't workin' So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive  [Verse 3: 2Pac] And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace? It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East Instead of war on poverty They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up Crack you up and pimp-smack you up You gotta learn to hold your own They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone But tell the cops they can't touch this I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this That's the sound of my tool You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped And I never get to lay back ‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback Some buck that I roughed up way back Comin' back after all these years ""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is  [Hook: Talent] That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah (You're my brother, you're my sister) That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is, aww yeah  [Outro: 2Pac] Some things'll never change  "

2Pac|Dear Mama|"  [Verse 1: 2Pac] When I was young, me and my mama had beef Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool With the big boys breakin' all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years We was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddies, the same drama When things went wrong we'd blame Mama I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary one day? And runnin' from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside And even as a crack fiend, Mama You always was a black queen, Mama I finally understand For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated  [Hook: Reggie Green & ""Sweet Franklin"" +  2Pac] Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama) Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated) Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?  [Verse 2: 2Pac] Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along I was lookin' for a father, he was gone I hung around with the thugs And even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin' I needed money of my own, so I started slangin' I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox I love payin' rent when the rent is due I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you ‘Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone, because you cared for me And I could see you comin' home after work late You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate You just workin' with the scraps you was given And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin' But now the road got rough, you're alone You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated  [Hook: Reggie Green & ""Sweet Franklin"" +  2Pac] Lady, don't you know we love ya?

I was like, this is like a fucking election It is that You know what I am saying Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like…  [Hook] And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead? Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? (You don't know) Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight? Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try? Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?  [Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.] Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up Choppin' rocks overnight The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White We had to grow dreads to change our description Two cops is on the milk box missin' Show they toes, you know they got stepped on A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon Runnin' from the police, picture that Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack That's why I bust back, it don't phase me When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker  [Hook] And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead? Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight? Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?

But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew And now media is tryna test me Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me Misery is all I see, that's my mind state My history with the police will shake the crime rate My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip Got tired of runnin' from the police  [Hook] And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead? Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight? Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try? Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?  [Outro: 2Pac] They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast  [The Notorious B.I.G.] I was more shocked than anything You know what I'm sayin'? But I wasn't more shocked of him dying I was more shocked of him… Pac is a strong dude, yo I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, ""Again?"" you know what I'm sayin'? He always getting shot, or shot at He going to pull through this one again Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over You know what I'm sayin'? But when he, when he died, I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by I mean, even though we was going through our drama I would never wish death on nobody You know what I'm sayin'? Because there ain't no coming back from that  "

Cole] To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure ‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin' So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin' Take it from a man that loves what you got And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care ‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while But I wanna see that crooked smile  [Hook: TLC] On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round  [Bridge: J. Cole + TLC] Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back 'round) Crooked smile, we can style on 'em You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round  [Verse 3: J. Cole] We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em Look at the nation That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten Seem like half the race is either on probation Or in jail, wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already I asked if my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele? But one more time for the 'Ville And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail I got money for the bail now, I'm well now If you askin' will I tell now – ayy, hell nah I ain’t snitchin' because man, they get them niggas stitches now If you was around, then you wouldn’t need a witness now How you like this crooked smile?  [Hook: TLC] On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down (that crooked smile) You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round  [Bridge: J. Cole + TLC] Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back 'round) Crooked smile, we can style on 'em You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round  [Ad-Libs: Choir]  [Outro: Choir] La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la On my way, on my way, on my way down On my way, on my way, on my way down You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round Back 'round You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round Back 'round You were the one that was tryna keep me way down But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round  [Music Video Directed by Sheldon Candis: For Aiyana Stanley-Jones and please reconsider your war on drugs. - A message from J.Cole]  "

When you tell me you love me, can't you see I'm tryna climb? Damn my nigga why you actin' like a bitch? If you scared to take a chance, how the fuck we gon' get rich? Come here baby why you always insecure? Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure  [Verse 1] Ain't a way around it no more, I am the greatest A lotta niggas sat on the throne, I am the latest I am the bravest, go toe to toe with the giants I ain't afraid of you niggas, I'll end up fading you niggas 'Fore it's all said and done, this nigga need medicine My uzi, it weighed a ton, I need me a better gun In fact I just might need two, cause niggas say they the one And I got something to prove Forgive me lord here they come, BLAOOW  [Hook] Nigga why you actin' like a ho?

Hold on tight to a nigga and be sure  [Verse 2] My inhibition's fighting my intuition Premature premonition, showing me the demolition Of these phony niggas, so ahead of my time Even when I rhyme about the future I be reminiscing You want the truth well come and listen I'm like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing As fate passes you by, half of you try The other half of you fry, too high to actually fly One day y'all have to decide, who you gon' be A scary nigga or a nigga that's gon' rule like me Keep it true like me, Cole you might be Like the new Ice Cube, meets the new Ice-T Meets 2 Live Crew, meets the new Spike Lee Meets Bruce like Wayne, meets Bruce like Lee Meets '02 Lil Wayne, in a new white tee Meets KD, ain't no nigga that can shoot like me!

Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt What you expected from me, I came from the dirt (Who's the king?) Money my motivator, the songs that I sing Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go Will I return or will I burn, never know Look in my eyes and see the future But don't sugar coat it  [Verse 3] Listen... History repeats itself and that's just how it goes Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with But not Jermaine, my aim too sick I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid And break the chains and change minds One verse at a time, and claim 2-6 And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?  [Outro] We all kings (We all kings nigga) Kings of ourselves first and foremost (True) While the people debate who's the king of this rap game Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine With every ounce of strength in his veins To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates And falls to the Earth from which it came It's done Ain't gonna be no more kings Be wary of any man that claims Because deep down he clings onto the need for power The reality, he's a coward Ultimately he's scared to die And sometimes so am I But when I'm in tune with the most high I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I Different kind of skin, different set of eyes Two different minds, but only one God (It's only one God nigga) It's for all the kings Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved

Drake|From Time|"  [Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib]  [Intro: Jhene Aiko] What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love You shouldn't have to deal with that I'd never make you feel like that, cause...  [Hook: Jhene Aiko] I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love  [Verse 1: Drake] I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different Started realizing a couple places I could take it I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation And influence a generation that's lacking in patience I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience Just me and my old man getting back to basics We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us We even talked about you and our couple of moments He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone Looking like you came from the 70's on your own My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone? You don't even know what you want from love anymore I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?  [Hook: Jhene Aiko] I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love  [Verse 2: Drake] Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it Cause that night I played her three songs Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment? Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore But girl, what qualities was I looking for before? Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?  [Hook: Jhene Aiko] I love me, I love me enough for the both of us That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love  [Outro: Baka] ""Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G Been a East Side ting Scarborough ting from time, G Been have up di ting dem from time, G So I don't know what's wrong with these Little wasteman out here eh?

Alright, alright, no church in the wild  [Verse 1: Jay Z] Tears on the mausoleum floor Blood stains the Colosseum doors Lies on the lips of a priest Thanksgiving disguised as a feast Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police Cocaine seats All white like I got the whole thing bleached Drug dealer chic I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach Is Pious pious cause God loves pious? Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek? All for Plato, screech I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats Preach  [Hook: Frank Ocean] Human beings in a mob What's a mob to a king?

What's a king to a god? What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything? Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild  "

Eminem|Rap God|"  [Produced by DVLP]  [Intro sample & Eminem] ""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings."" ""But I'm only going to get this one chance."" ""Something's wrong, I can feel it."" Six minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on! ""Just a feeling I've got. Like something is about to happen, but I don't know what. If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances."" ""You are just what the doc ordered.""  [Hook 1] I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot  [Verse 1] But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My pen'll go off when I half-cock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a livin' and a killin' off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack I'm an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with) This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac' Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots, and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad It's actually disastrously bad for the wack While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece  [Hook 2] I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box? Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard Everybody want the key and the secret To rap immortality like I have got  [Verse 2] Well, to be truthful the blueprint's Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the Earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!) MC's get taken to school with this music 'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bust a rhyme"" Now I lead a new school full of students Me? I'm a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position To meet Run–D.M.C. and induct them Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of (shame) You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'? Little gay-looking boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy You're witnessing a massacre Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy ""Oy vey, that boy's gay!"", that's all they say, looking boy You get a thumbs up, pat on the back And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, looking boy Hey, looking boy! What you say, looking boy? I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, looking boy I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit Get outta my face, looking boy! Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy, 'cause—  [Hook 3] I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod This planet's Krypton – no, Asgard, Asgard  [Verse 3] So you be Thor and I'll be Odin You rodent, I'm omnipotent Let off, then I'm reloadin' Immediately with these bombs I'm totin' And I should not be woken I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatin' But I got your mom deep-throatin' I'm out my Ramen Noodle We have nothin' in common, poodle I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil It's me, my honesty's brutal But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure, somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes To maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case, 'cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come tryin' To censor you, like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9 See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows You write normal? Fuck being normal! And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad Singin' to a man while they played piano Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"" Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad) Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating 'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music ""Oh, he's too mainstream."" Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"" because I found a hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it ""I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use."" Let me know when it occurs to you While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to? Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie But look at the accolades these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you! I'm drunk – so Satan, take the fuckin' wheel! I'm asleep in the front seat Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky"" But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have, then you may be a little patient And more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then? Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and Don't be a retard – be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a god?  "

Eminem|Lose Yourself|  [Intro] Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity To seize everything you ever wanted In one moment, would you capture it or just let it slip?  [Verse 1] Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow! Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad, but he won't Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's Back to the lab again, yo!

Eminem|Bad Guy|"  [Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes][Verse 1] It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work All it takes is one song on the radio, you're Right back on it, reminding me all over again How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search Maybe I needed to grow up a little first Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt But I'm coming for closure Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for The way that you turned your back on me Just when I may have needed you most Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing? You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine Well, I've never recovered But tonight I bet you that what you're 'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this."" Heart's saying: ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset.""  [Hook: Sarah Jaffe] I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh, you had me pegged the first time You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy (Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un) I just hate to be the bad guy (Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)  [Verse 2] And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it? Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch! Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it! You left our family in shambles And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed? May be gone, but he's not forgotten And don't think ‘cause he's been out the pictures So long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya You're wrong and that shit was rotten And the way you played him, same shit you did to me; cold Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through? Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to? Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin' Letters, you don't respond to 'em Fuck it, I'm coming to see you And, gee, who better to talk to than you? The cause of my problems My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you Poof, then I'm gone, voosh  [Hook: Sarah Jaffe] I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through Oh, you had me pegged the first time You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy I just hate to be the bad guy (Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un) I just hate to be the bad guy (Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)  [Verse 3] I've been drivin' around your side of this town Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now Finally I found your new address, park in your drive Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house See, it's sad it came to this point Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy It's revenge that I seek So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window Like I reached my full potential: I peeked Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak All the way 'round to the back porch Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this You don't plan for intruders beforehand? Surprised to see me? Cat caught your tongue? Gag, chloroform rag, gag, almost hack-up a lung Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk? And here's your Bronco hat You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it We're in the car right now – wait, here comes my favorite lyric ""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"" And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun! Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell Bitch, I even have your initials I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck The best place you could be buried alive is right here Two more exits, time is quite near Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror (Oh, God! Police! Aaaghh!) Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least New plan, Stan! Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"" Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge Ha ha, big bro, it's for you, Slim, this is for him And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good Now say you hate homos again! [Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner][Verse 4] I also represent Anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in When they say all of this is approachin' its end But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds Toilets clogged, yeah, ‘cause I'm talking a lot of Shit but I'm backing it all up But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers After the track is demolished, I am your lack of a conscience I'm the ringing in your ears I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged Grab for some water But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow I'm the bullies you hate that you became With every faggot you slaughtered Coming back on you, every woman you insult Batter, but the double-standards you have When it comes to your daughters I represent everything you take for granted ‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone ‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam No more fans that are calling your name Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!” Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow If you don't stop after they call ya Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions If there's anything you have left to say 'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother So 'fore you rest your case Better make sure you're packin' a wallop So, one last time, I'm back Before it fades into black and it's all over Behold the final chapter in a saga Tryin' to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle Twice, the magic that started It all, tragic portrait of an artist Tortured, trapped in his own drawings Tap into thoughts blacker and darker Than anything imaginable; here goes a wild stab in the dark As we pick up where the last Mathers left off  "

Eminem|Survival|  [Hook: Liz Rodrigues] This is survival of the fittest This is do or die This is the winner takes it all So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all  [Verse 1: Eminem] Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends It was 'bout bustin' raps And standin' for somethin': fuckin' acronym Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end? It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up I'm afraid of what will happen to them wolves When the thought of being thrown Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up Hands up like it's 12 noon Nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers Nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, ‘cause—  [Hook: Liz Rodrigues] This is survival of the fittest This is do or die This is the winner takes it all So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all  [Verse 2: Eminem] I can see the finish line with each line that I finish I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post And if I don't got enough in the tank Maybe I can just siphon enough To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what? They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut What? Like I give a fuck! But I light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow I'm stabbin' myself with a fuckin' knife in the gut While I'm wipin' my butt ‘Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut I get excited at the sight of my blood You're in a fight with a nut ‘Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what Got me this far, picture me quittin' Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut! It's survival of what?

But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve ‘Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, ‘cause trust me My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be Allergic to failure, ‘cause everytime I come close to it I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

And, Mom, I know he's not around But don't you place the blame on me As you pour yourself another drink, yeah  [Chorus: Nate Ruess] I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on Maybe we took this too far  [Verse 1: Eminem] I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far? ""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom Though far be it from you to be calm Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb Equivalent to chemical warfare And forever, we could drag this on and on, but Agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve ""Little prick, just leave!"" Ma, let me grab my fucking coat Anything to have each other's goats Why we always at each other's throats? Especially when Dad, he fucked us both We're in the same fuckin' boat You'd think that'd make us close (nope) Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go Back to grandma's house – it's straight up the road And I was the man of the house The oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old And that's when I realized you were sick And it wasn't fixable or changeable And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—  [Chorus: Nate Ruess] I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on Maybe we took this too far  [Verse 2: Eminem] ‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though ‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow But I'm sorry, Momma, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so Never meant that far to take it though ‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes That song I no longer play at shows And I cringe every time it's on the radio And I think of Nathan being placed in a home And all the medicine you fed us And how I just wanted you to taste your own But now the medication's taking over And your mental state's deteriorating slow And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both Foster care, that cross you bear Few may be as heavy as yours, but I love you, Debbie Mathers Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause One thing I never asked was Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus Owned a collection of maps And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas If someone ever moved 'em from me That you coulda bet your asses If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em And although one has only met their grandma once You pulled up in our drive one night As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths And I saw your headlights as I looked back And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to Thank you for being my mom and my dad So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to get this off my chest I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashin' So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom  [Chorus: Nate Ruess] I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on Maybe we took this too far  [Bridge: Nate Ruess] I want a new life (start over) One without a cause (clean slate) So I'm coming home tonight Well, no matter what the cost And if the plane goes down Or if the crew can't wake me up Well, just know that I'm alright I was not afraid to die Oh, even if there's songs to sing Well, my children will carry me Just know that I'm alright I was not afraid to die Because I put my faith in my little girls So I never say goodbye cruel world Just know that I'm alright I am not afraid to die  [Chorus: Nate Ruess] I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on Maybe we took this too far I want a new life  "
