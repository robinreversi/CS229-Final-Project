On the 22nd day, you’ve found the way.  On December 3rd, one day before my 44th birthday I will embark on a 22 Days challenge to go completely vegan, or as I prefer to call it, plant-based!! This all began a few months back when a good friend and vegan challenged me to embrace a “plant-based breakfast” everyday. It was surprisingly easier on me than I thought…  Why now? There’s something spiritual to me about it being my 44th birthday and the serendipity behind the number of days in this challenge; 22 (2+2=4) coupled with the fact that the challenge ends on Christmas day…It just feels right!  So you can call it a spiritual and physical cleanse. I will post my progress… Any professional vegans out there that have any great food spots please help out! Please ha. I don’t know what happens after Christmas. A semi-vegan, a full plant-based diet? Or just a spiritual and physical challenge? We’ll see…  Best of luck and health!  P.S. B is also joining me.  I will let my friend Marco explain the benefits of a plant based diet here.Jay Z|22 Two's|"  Yo wassup everybody, this is Maria Davis, Mad Wednesdays, we here tonight to have a good time (""Yo!

So I feel as though, you know, shit, the violence is just making us more cold hearted animals you know some shit they can't fuck with cause we worse than anything they talked about it  [Interviewer]: Let's talk about the black panther thing. How did you come up growing up in it and handle that type of environment  [2Pac]: I'm saying my peoples, my folks staying down in Penitentiaries for bank robberies and killing cops and you know what I'm saying, that 's my family tree it ain't no stretch for me to be talking the shit I be talking and they didn't do it screaming let's go move the White— they was screaming African liberation I'm talking about straight motherfucking G's but now they in jail now you know, and didn't nobody gave a fuck and in this mothefuckers out here with beads, and all that drama that they be wearing and my folks is in the Pen' over that shit so I takes shit like fuck it. I'm not that type of nigga that's gon be like a-ramba ramba, you know I live right here and it's hard right motherfucking here I help y'all soon as I get there but while I'm right here, I'm speaking the language that we speak, I'm dressing in the clothes that we dressing and I'm fighting the battle that we got to fight, you know what I'm saying, and if niggas wanna be down shit it can be an all nigga thang but if niggas don't, shit I be by motherfucking self but niggas will be following you know what I'm saying and niggas ain't gonna see it till the last second but now this ain't no shit that just happening in this Cent'— you know in this little 10 years this shit been goin' on for a gang of time, everybody been talking about it everybody been making song about. it's just for real you know what I'm saying and we runnin' out of niggas to bury  [Interviewer]: Where's the music going 2Pac? is it gon' get harder?  [2Pac]: Shit, I don't know it depends on niggas balls. If niggas got big nuts like me it's gon get way harder. but shit if niggas got little nuts, it's gon start getting back to a different type rap you know what I'm saying partying and fucking and all of that type of shit because that's what we talking about when they don't let us talk about what we really wanna talk about. So it depends you can listen to the radio and listen to what niggas be talking about, and if they start talking that crazy shit then it ain't cool. If niggas still talking that thug shit you know that hardcore shit it's all good. But if they talking about like ""hitting"" you know all that crazy shit you know, it ain't gon' be like that. Not that nothing's wrong with that, but it's something wrong with it if you think that's hardcore you know what I'm saying  [Interviewer]:  [?]influenced through rappers head on  the kids????  [2Pac]: ultimate, ultimate. But see some of these kids don't know that some of these rappers ain't like that and that's the bad part you know the good part it just some rappers who took that shit seriously like me I feel as though everything I rap about shit anybody could check my card on it and I gotta be able to pullin' pull show and improve whenever somebody wanna pull my card on it some of these niggas gotta do the same thang but it ain't like that they screaming they soldiers but they not being soldiers in reality so it's like that what's the bad part cause some of these kids really believe you you know they really doing that shit niggas be listening to tapes and knocking cop off and shit you know what I'm sayin and that shit is deep you know what I'm sayin  [Interviewer]: is that what you saying in like Strictly for niggas [?] in the album that came out  [2Pac]: yeah it's like,you know like, shit, fuck it ain't nuttin wrong with it being all black thang that don't mean we're racist cause we want niggas to survive ain't nuttin wrong with that we say this just for blacks can't nobody say shit if you sayin we strictly for niggas can't nobody I am being racist I ain't saying fuck all the crackers I'm just saying still strictly for my niggas that's all niggas thang you know and when I'm down mexicans all that wanna be down but if that shit really it's for niggas  [Interviewer]: What about the female rappers [?] cause you be dissing the bitches and hoes and all that shit. How you feel about that?  [2Pac]: I feel as though it really ain't as big as everybody making you know. Even the females know what's bitches females don't even hang with females. So why would they expect nigga understand something they don't understand it that's one. Two, is that these bitches is like boss she out there handling her business she aim saying why call me bitches; SHE CLOWNING! And that's what you do, that's how you show and improve bet no nigga gon' fuck with her. If you call yourself a bitch, Who can call you a bitch? But fuck it, I'm a nigga that's just like I don't even believe in that I'm not a bitch shit. If you're not a bitch. Why the fuck in that conversation? Why the fuck you even put-- I ain't no bitch, what okay  [Interviewer]: What about the female rappers?  [2Pac]: female rappers some is row, some is not, some still sellin' cock, some getting pimped, some is fucking whoever doing their music and soon them niggas ain't getting more pussy they ain't putting no more records out so that's like the damn part, if they just you know put they cock in they hand and just drop records it would be cool but they keep fucking mixing business and pleasure that a nigga can't really be a fan of that I can't really get in into boss' music if she's hardcore I'm gon' stay hardcore cause I can be down for that liking this nigga tape nah I won't buy this bitch tape I buy this nigga tape but if she start flip flopping it's a difference anybody start flip flopping it's a difference   [2Pac]: every album I did I ain't trippin off that only time that I ever sat back and wrote the rhyme that I was goin' do and thought about it like it's the ""Same Song"" song I did with Digital Underground besides that every record that came out that 2Pac did I did high and drunk in the studio while they was making the beat like laying the beat down and that's why I be soundin' little sloppy but that's all it be like fuck it I feel as though niggas drunk and high when they gon' still listen to it you gon' like it or not and I don't even picture myself to be as like Dre I just picture myself to be like me I would be putting out Underground if nobody ever buy my record and I'll selling up to whereas I can putting out underground tapes from there it's cool though you know if you just signed with Death Row that's gon' be cool too, they gon' be doing my nigga up it's all cool shit they came to me and said: ""Do you wanna work with the Row"" and I said ""hell yeah"" Dre wanna do shit on my music, my next album I can't really ask him nuttin more than that really in '93  [Interviewer]: so that's beginning of a new family thang  [2Pac]:Yep, we goin' on that tour, it's new thug life and death row ain't that a bitch  [Interviewer]: You coming from up north right you coming from up north and then coming down here just chilling how is it from like up there in Oakland?  [2Pac]: it really ain't change just different cultures I feel as though the ghetto was the ghetto it ain't near ghetto I can't go to and kicking it and come up and I don't care who colors or not I didn't always think that so I'm not being cocky I was scared in L.A. to whereas I didn't know nuttin about the game thang that's the only thing I was scared of just ignorance not knowing we're not to go shit if I been there long enough they can smoke me I really don't care, it's all good, cause I'm in here, I'm in here Watts, this is Compton there's no place that I won't go and I feel as though if you got love and if you putting out real shit you can do that if you kicking that shit from your heart you can go wherever your heart want you to go if you kicking that shit from the white folks office them white folks gon' have to bring you through the hood if you they tell you when you be a g shit they gon' have to tell you when you come to the hood so it's cool like this, since I got big nuts, my big nuts take me wherever I wanna go and I love that I like that I like that I went to Chicago, we was fucking with them gang niggas out there it's a good feeling to be, you see these white folks running out like a fucker from these niggas then you get there they all like ""What's up 'Pac""  they all like down so it's true niggas can unite you know -- -- Mo hand me that 40 ammunition , 40 millimeter ammunition -- I show you how to trick, this a 10 millimeter but I'm loading it with 40 millimeter bullets cause it would work watch  [Interviewer]: In this like, anger you shooting at these targets right here?  [2Pac]: Anger?  [Interviewer]: Yeah  [2Pac]: that is when I got that MAC-11 I don't be tryna aim, I just be tryna hit they ass but when I got the glock I aims and hit they ass (word)  --  [2Pac]: huh what on my music? uhm shit the hood everywhere I been I done live in New York that's where I was raised that's where I came up you know and I done move to I done live in Harlem, The Bronx just in New York if you know that's two different cultures then I done live to Baltimore, Marlon that's a whole another type culture that's that the Washington, D.C. scene I didn't live there for 4 years I didn't live in Oakland for 4 years I didn't came out to L.A. and here I be it's like you moving all them ghettos you gon' pick up the slang and all them towns, you gon' pick up one common thing which is dope dealing and that's what everybody do, everywhere I went that was the common thread you know dope everybody gotta make it you know what I'm saying no matter how bad we look down on that that the no. 1 career for young black male in America in the real America  [Interviewer]: [?] music  [2Pac]: I don't really got nuttin, I rap, I'm a hip hop fan first I was first and foremost that where I am, it shows when I'm meeting niggas I like I show it ain't no on that bullshit cause I got big nuts, I don't care I like them niggas but now I like ""Beat It"" I like all the hardcore niggas I buy they tapes my [?] any day any car I on anywhere I go you can check my pockets or anything it's tapes hip hop and I don't listen -- it ain't got to be the nigga that is platinum it could be some underground tape I got from Chicago but I spread that shit around I really do enjoy the music I like that hardcore shit I think it's good it get me through a lot to shit it get me through a lot to know that another nigga is feeling what I feel, going through what I going through And if you keep it hardcore that's how it is but if we always talking about the good time shit when a nigga having a bad time he gotta turn his deck off and listen to keep sweating it's not like, shit hip hop should go through every single emotion that we have you know  --- ---  [2Pac]: like that is the perfect example when people used to ask me last year what you call your music hardcore I didn't even put it in that position I said it was soul music cause that's what it is to me it's like Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye you know how they used to like sang and no matter who is listen to the tape was still a black music, it was black music and  that's how you know the rap is it's like like ""Straight Up Menace"" that song ""Straight Up Menace"" Compton Most Wanted when that shit came out nigga was having a bad day you know I was on my way to get some weed fucked up you know I done been intense and shit and I was listened to that shit just to know that another nigga was feeling the same way you feel a rapper that you know that you seen and the music fit and the words fit that shit is like you know get you through just like as if you gotta phone call from a homie to see I understand you know what I'm saying it's like the music let you know that another person understand and for the black community especially we have like broken families with no father no big brothers and so the music becomes the big brother or the music becomes the father because you listen to all the fathers so you be like Ice Cu..

I have to be completely honest and say there’s a part of me that resents that. I view rap similar to how I view comedy. It’s going to ruffle feathers at times. It’s going to go “too far”. I do not believe that an apology is needed every time someone is offended, especially when that apology is really only for the sake of saving an endorsement or cleaning up bad press.  With that said, this is not the case today. This letter is sincere. This apology IS necessary.  In a recent verse on the song “Jodeci Freestyle”, I said something highly offensive to people with Autism. Last week, when I first saw a comment from someone outraged about the lyric, I realized right away that what I said was wrong. I was instantly embarrassed that I would be ignorant enough say something so hurtful. What makes the crime worse is that I should have known better.  To the entire Autism community who expressed outrage, I’m moved and inspired by your passion, and I’m amazed at how strong you are as a unit. I have now read stories online from parents about their struggles and triumphs with raising an Autistic child and I admire how incredibly strong you have to be to do so. It’s touching. It also makes what I said even more embarrassing for me. I feel real shame. You have every right to be angry.  To anyone suffering from Autism, either mildly or severely, I am sorry. I’m bound to make mistakes in my life, but in my heart I just want to spread Love.  I want to educate myself more on Autism, and I’ll gladly own my mistake and serve as an example to today’s generation that there’s nothing cool about mean-spirited comments about someone with Autism. People with this disorder and their loved ones have to go through so much already, the last thing they need is to hear something as ignorant as what I said. I understand.  To the parents who are fighting through the frustrations that must come with raising a child with severe autism, finding strength and patience that they never knew they had; to the college student with Asperger’s Syndrome; to all those overcoming Autism. You deserve medals, not disrespect. I hope you accept my sincere apology.  Much Love  -ColeJCole|Before I'm Gone|  [Verse 1] I hit the weed I told myself the last time would be my last I don’t trust my own niggas now my mind racing fast Got my foot up on the gas, got a hundred on the dash If the police run up on me I ain't stopping for their ass Boy you know my L’s dirty, if they stop me I’m goin to jail surely I’ll be next to my brother in the cell no bail for me Man let me out send me back to bitches that smell purdy And all I gotta do is call once and she 'dere all ready Yeah buddy can't you tell I'm goin through hell I don’t even open my mail I’m in the shower with soap and the towel, I need cleansing Bad bitches all on the prowl they need Benzes Pussy niggas running they mouth and we ain't flinching They names ain't even mentioned I got dreams bigger than your whole team You niggas so broke yet somehow you so green I guess it's envy, started with a penny now i’m getting plenty money  [Hook] And one time for the city, yea And two times for you, hey And one time for the city, hey And two times for you, uhh  [Verse 2] Look kid, its raining outside boy Fuck an umbrella, niggas banging outside boy They guns'll dumbbell a nigga Tired of telling niggas that's deceased, rest in peace We tired of only having just a piece And fuck policing, they killing niggas what's the reason His daughter starving and she fucking freezing So no wonder why he fucking squeezing They out here bussin’ leavin’ niggas stuck and bleedin’ on the flo’ Bullets wet you like a semen on a ho Breathing slow man, I'm in hell One day you tryna make rent, next day you in jail Lord knows he meant well So I take the pencil and write like a pen pal Some shit that’s darker than the tints up on the windshield Welcome to Sinville where niggas on base Shit is looking like an infield High as a Sprint bill What you think, that's the reason why this ink in my pen kills Phoney niggas until they are extinct, bitch I’ve been real  [Hook] And one time for the city, yea And two times for you, hey And one time for the city, hey And two times for you, uhh  [Verse 3] Them old niggas sayin’ Cole the wrong one bringin’ the city shine All he ever doin’ is paintin’ pictures of crime Tellin’ stories of pain, paintin’ pictures of dope Bitch if you listenin' I’m paintin’ pictures of hope That boy in class embarrassed because he broke Hopin’ today he won’t be the butt of somebody’s joke See me I lived it all from dirt-poor in a trailer Worried about my mother and never trustin’ my neighbors To middle-class with a backyard and my own room To bein’ the only black kid in my homeroom Academically gifted and followed my own rules Was runnin’ the streets hey ma I’ll be home soon Was out chasin’ hoes, was out hoopin’ Them niggas wasn’t ballin’ but yet they was foul shootin’ So meet the newest role model who don’t know how to fake this shit Never sold a rock and look I made it bitch  [Hook] And one time for the city, yea And two times for you, hey And one time for the city, hey And two times for you, uhh  [Outro] Girl it’s been so long, I’ve been gone from you But you ain’t gotta worry ’bout the thangs I do It’s hard but the thought of you would ease my pain Girl I promise they gon’ know our name Ain’t seen you smile in awhile But I been dreamin’ ’bout youJCole|Be Free|"  [Verse 1] And I'm in denial And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile I know, I be on the go And there ain't no drink out there that can numb my soul Oh no  [Hook] All we wanna do is take the chains off All we wanna do is break the chains off All we wanna do is be free All we wanna do is be free All we wanna do is take the chains off All we wanna do is break the chains off All we wanna do is be free All we wanna do is be free  [Verse 2] Can you tell me why Every time I step outside I see my niggas die I'm lettin' you know That there ain't no gun they make that can kill my soul Oh no  [Hook] All we wanna do is take the chains off All we wanna do is break the chains off All we wanna do is be free All we wanna do is be free All we wanna do is take the chains off All we wanna do is break the chains off All we wanna do is be free All we wanna do is be free  [Eyewitness account from Dorian Johnson:] So now it was like the officer is pulling him inside the car and he's trying to pull away.  At no time the officer said that he was going to do anything until he pulled out his weapon. His weapon was drawn and he said, ""I'll shoot you"" or, ""I'm going to shoot"" and in the same moment, the first shot went off. We looked down and he was shot and there was blood coming from him. Then we took off running  [Bridge] Are we all alone, fighting on our own Please give me a chance, I don't wanna dance Somethings got me down, I will stand my ground Don't just stand around, don't just stand around  [Eyewitness account from Dorian Johnson:] As we took off running I ducked and hid for my life, because I was fearing for my life. I hid behind the first car I saw. My friend, he kept running, and he told me to keep running because he feared for me too. So as he was running the officer was trying to get out of the car, and once he got out the car he pursued my friend but his weapon was drawn.

She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was ""Pon de Replay,"" and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called ""Work.""  Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna.  Captivating from day one, the iconic being known as Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them that's often a peak, but for her that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.  When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward.  What's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself.  This woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one.  She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and gentlemen, the recipient of the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award for 2016: Rihanna.

Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling being killed it left me feeling disheartened, emotional and truly scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something.  It's impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago. No one begins their life as a hashtag. Yet the trend of being reduced to one continues.  This is real and I'm concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family, my friends, and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I believe things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step.  My thoughts and prayers are with the Sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence.  Be safe out there. More life.Drake|AM 2 PM|  [Verse 1: Nickelus F] Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?

I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused. Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted. This was a learning lesson for both of us, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to try to right this wrong. J.

I want to say some ""thank you""s really quick. Thank God for Stephen Hill, who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesn't care about what Ghost somebody's driving or how big somebody's house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic, current, and futuristic black music every day. So, make some noise for Stephen Hill to start this  So, since this is pre-taped and the fact that Adam Blackstone used to be my music director, I'm pretty sure he's not gonna start the music on me. If I go Chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when I went and visited Minister Louis Farrakhan, and I just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that I had been talking about over the past couple years. And it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. You know, at the barbershop and everything, I used to hear people talking about, ""You know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon' go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon' go and get a rich black dude."" But I want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. So it ain't got nothing to do with the money  And it takes me back to a story that she told me where her father, Robert Kardashian, walked out, and on the side of his Bentley, they wrote ""Nigga lover"" because Robert Kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got O.J. off. She had never seen her father curse, get mad, he was the most laid back human being. And he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down, and she sat there crying and said, ""Dad why you going so crazy?"" He said to her, ""One day you may have a black child. A beautiful, beautiful, beautiful black child. And it's gonna be hard, you're gonna see how hard it is.""  So, true enough, we deal with racism because there are different races, or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races, as opposed to the macro, which is the human race. The bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why I'm not allowed to be empowered is because of race, because of people's perception of celebrity, because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper, but not the idea of becoming an owner. And they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy idea  Harriet Tubman said she could have freed so many more, and I'm sorry mom if that was incorrect English. Harriet Tubman could have freed more if they only knew they weren't free. So don't think that because we can afford this custom Balmain suit that we're free. And don't think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that we're free. And don't think that because it's 3% of a gated community that has colored people in it that we're free. It's the mentality, the slave mentality, where we all eventually become slaves to that car. Slaves to the perception. Slaves to the idea of being cool  I thought it was so appropriate the way Wayne Brady kicked his whole shit off tonight. For us to express ourselves. Our power, our oil, since we don't own any oil. Our oil is our expression, is our influence. Don't never let them take that away. And when we have the chance to express it and influence, don't only do it for us, do it for the human race  "Kanye West|30 Hours|  [Sample] Baby lion goes Where the islands go  [Verse 1] You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone Million dollar renovations to a happy home My ex says she gave me the best years of her life I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right I wake up, assessin' the damages Checkin' MediaTakeOut Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch But it's blurry enough to get the fake out I wake up, all veggies no eggs I hit the gym, all chest no legs Yep, then I made myself a smoothie Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago Ándale ándale E.I, E.I, uh-oh You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone You was the best of all time at the time though Yeah, you wasn't mine though  [Chorus] But I still drove 30 hours And I, I still drove 30 hours to you  [Verse 2] I remember rappin' for Jay and Cam Young producer just trying to get his flows off I remember being nervous to do Victoria's Secret 'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl You don't love me, you just pretendin' I need a happy beginnin', middle and endin' Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago It's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you You call down for an omelet Girl it's 5 in the morning You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob 'Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job  [Chorus] And I drove back 30 hours  [Bridge] Were remains that long to lose sad Better unsaid Always turn, oh  [Outro: Kanye West + André 3000] 3 Stacks, can you help me out? 30 hours Yeah, this type of shit you just ride out to 30 hours 30 hours I just be like, it was my idea to have an open relationship Now a nigga mad Now I'm 'bout to drive 90 miles like Matt Barnes to kill... 30 hours Just to kill..

[Crowd cheers]  "Kanye West|57th Annual Grammy After Party Stream of Consciousness|"  I don't even know what he said, I just know that the Grammys, if they want real artists to keep coming back, they need to stop playing with us. We ain't finna play with them no more. ""***Flawless"", Beyoncé video. And Beck needs to respect artistry, and he should've given his award to Beyoncé. And at this point, we're tired of it. Because what happens is, when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in their face after they deliver monumental feats of music, you're disrespectful to inspiration. We as musicians have to inspire people who go to work every day, and they listen to that Beyoncé album and they feel like it takes them to another place. Then they do this whole promotional event, they'll run the music over somebody’s speech, the artist, because they want commercial advertising. Like, no, we not playing with them no more. By the way, I got my wife, I got my daughter and I got my clothing line, so I'm not going to do nothing to put my daughter at risk but I am here to fight for creativity. That's the reason why I didn’t say anything tonight. But y'all know what it meant when 'Ye walks on the stage  "Kanye West|A 97.1 Interview Part 2 (8/28/13)|"  [Michelle] I like that because I thought you're on the way to doing things differently, all the promotion around your album. It was really like just awesome to me, because it wasn't the traditional roll out that they do to radio where they send the single and then they're doing is they're doing that and, you know, you're doing an appearance on, you know, whatever TV show. But it was really cool. It was like when you showed in over 60 cities. You showed the-- you know, I wouldn't even call them videos. It was more of like a-- just an art exhibition that you did in these different cities. It is kind of, ""What's spurred that, to do it that way?""  [Kanye] I mean, we have dreams. We wake up, and we make them happen. I appreciate that my label allowed me to go unorthodox with that. And there's people at the label who appreciate it and there's people who don't appreciate that. It's like non-traditional in that way. But I have to push. And really, it's all practice to me. Being a musician is practice. Life is practice. You know, so it's not like a in go-- so I'm fine to make a mistake. I'm fine to, like, put out an auto tune album that no one understands. I'm fine to put out a complete punk new wave album that no one understands. I'm not trying to maintain, you know, some spot in the hip-hop charts on radio or something like that. I'm trying to open up people's minds. I want people to think more. I want people to feel like it's okay to create. I want people to feel like it's okay to make mistakes in front of people and follow what their dreams are and not feel boxed in. I want people to feel like, you know, awesome is possible. I want them to, you know, feel like, you know-- it's not a matter of just even what I'm doing at DONDA. It's the amount of people that are hearing me and now they're going to fight to get the best ideas out. Because the world will only be saved through good intention and design, It's not going to be saved is politics. The irony is, what holds things back? Politics! So how could that push things forward?  [Michelle] I heard you say that you were trying to work out a deal with the Gap and politics held you back from doing that with your merchandise for the tour, and it may be just wonder what, sort of-- elaborate on that. What are you talking about when you say ""politics?""  [Kanye] I mean it, like, what would happen if I was able to design a collection and was like backed by the Gap? It would be awesome, right?  [Michelle] It would totally be awesome, but then my question for you is, but you have-- you're not hurting. You're doing well, so couldn't you just do that yourself? You don't need the Gap.  [Kanye] No, you can't. You need the infrastructure. It's not a matter of just having money.  [Michelle] But you have a great staff set up in everything, I feel like...  [Kanye] No, I don't have a great staff at all. That is a skill set that takes years and years of anything. If I wanted to get into the coal business and I had-- and also, ""well-off"" is that, that is-- what's the word I'm looking for? I'm trying to use the simplest word sometimes. Yeah, it's all relative. Because I'm not, because, okay-- I could make an amount that seems, like, really crazy to people, like 10 million a year, right? To open up a new fashion company might costs 15 million. So if I went and took all the money I had and I invested it into trying to do it like that, it could leave me 5 million in debt.  [Michelle] That's fair enough, I get that.  [Kanye] And then you're not well-off.  [Michelle] That's-- yeah-- I'm sorry, I know it's not all about money, but I've just been saying that the team that you have at DONDA and-- I would think that you could hire anybody that may want to come and work for you.  [Kanye] I'll-- now we are. Because of what we're doing. Because of the way we're turning up. Now we can get real designers, real infrastructure. But it's really hard. Just as much as, you know, getting a creative person is hard, it's hard to get the back office guys; the people that run the-- [?] who do the real work. Yeah, you get the Rihannas, the Big Seans, the Kanyes, but you need the Barry Weiss, the Steve Barlows and [?], and like these people, you know, all the people all the people who get mentioned on the Grammy speeches, and you just can't, that's-- what you're saying is like-- Okay, you're a major recording artist because you signed to a major label. Can't you just do independent clothing? The answer is, ""No."" Now, can't you just get a clothing deal from a major label? The answer is, also, currently is, ""No."" And that's the issue. That's the Truman Show wall. That's the glass ceilings. That's the Michael Jackson can't get his video played. Because everybody-- nobody is looking at what Obama is wearing. I'm the number one most influential person on the globe in fashion. [?] is a great designer. I love Saint Laurent and their $1 million dollar jackets and everything. I love it. But, I should have backing from one in the majors. Louis Vuitton group which is Bernard Arnault, Karen group, which is France Rapinoe, or Renzo Rosso, who owns Diesel and Margiela. Bottom line. And that's the only way it's going to be, because the thing is, when you try to go, you know, when you go less that, the level of the product is just isn't where should be. Yeah I'm doing T-shirts that are amazing. We put all our design into it, and so many people like T-shirts. And I love that. I get people T-shirts. But I also want to create entire gyms. Like gyms. Like I want to make a gym. I wanna make a store. I want to do apartment complexes. I want to build cities. I want to be involved with hyperloop when it comes to reality, with Eli Musk. That's the conversation I want to be in. So I will not be held into a box of being a musician, or that you get it somehow confused. I don't look like a rapper. Now rappers look like me, but when I started, I wasn't gangsta enough. You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm getting married to Kim Kardashian, and I've never played in the NBA.  (Laughter)  [Michelle Oh my god.  [Kanye] So, that's thought.  [Michelle] You know, you raise a really good point here. If you just joined us, I'm Michelle and we're live on 97.1 Radio Los Angeles with Kanye West. You know, in creativity in rap music, do you think that, because I don't-- you definitely don't do things like everybody else. Do you think there's a certain lack of originality and creativity, not, you know, I'm not going to say that for all rap, but it seems like you do things a little differently. And a love that that; with music, I mean.  [Kanye West] There's a lack of creativity in every field, because people are afraid. Because the powers control people. And the only place where people can be fully creative is in Silicon Valley. Everything else, there's an old regime. And oligarchs are controlling whether or not you're going to be able to feed your kids. So no one can say the type of stuff that I'm saying because they'll lose their job.  There is a a lack in creativity in Hollywood. There's a lack in creativity in clothing. There's a lack creativity in the education system. There's a lack in creativity on the globe period! @hen you look up and look at billboard ads, the majority of them suck. There's a lack creativity in advertising, in agencies. There's just a lack, because the person with the good idea needs to pay dues for 20 years before their positioned to say the idea, and they might not have the relevancy anymore. Right now, I have the relevancy and I have the perspective and I have the voice and I'm going to scream as loud as I can. And ain't nothing gon' happen to me except success.  [Michelle] You're here to save it, man. At least, like, change it, which I love. Whoo! That heat, I love that.  There's so much passion because I share a lot of the same-- where the view is my passion, and I feel like people don't always get it. You know, and they're like, ""Gosh, it's kind of harsh"" with everyone. You've just got to be true to yourself. You know? I got to-- by the way, before I forget, you know with your clothing and your fashion, we were just talking about your merch line.  [Kanye] Really quick, and don't forget your question, please. I wanna stop using the term ""fashion,"" because Eve made Adam bite an apple. And since then, it's been illegal to be naked. I'm helping people follow the law in style. I'm helping people with their opinion on how to follow the law. This isn't about fashion. I'm creating new standards, things so you don't have to think about it. Fashion is too high of a skill set. It just needs to be easy. Easy as the hoodie and jeans that I'm wearing. And I'll do all the hard work. I'll figure out exactly where that collar goes and exactly where that hoodie sits and-- and how many times you can wash that fabric and stuff so that it looks better 5 years from now. I'll do the hard work for you. Fashion is forcing people to do all this hard work where you look back 2 years from now and say, ""That looked crazy!""  There are certain things that are just standard. A suit jacket is a suit jacket is a suit jacket. A hoodie is a hoodie is a hoodie. Jeans are jeans are jeans. And a Michael Jordan sneaker is a Michael Jordan sneaker. Now, let's take our kids to the park. It's not about fashion. It's about life, and me helping it become more awesome...  (TO BE CONTINUED)  "Kanye West|"A Concert for Hurricane Relief PSA - ""George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People"""|  [Mike Myers]: With the breach of three levees protecting New Orleans, the landscape of the city has changed dramatically, tragically, and perhaps irreversibly. There is now over twenty-five feet of water where there was once city streets and thriving neighbourhoods.  [Kanye West]: I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family, it says “they’re looting.” If you see a white family, it says “they’re looking for food.” And you know, it’s been five days because most of the people are black and even for me to complain about I would be a hypocrite because I’ve tried to turn away from the TV because it’s too hard to watch. I’ve even been shopping before even giving a donation.  So now I’m calling my business manager right now to see what’s… what is the biggest amount I can give and… and just to imagine if I was… if I was down there and those are… those are my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help. With… with the setup, the way America is set up to help the…uh the uh, the poor, the… the black people, the uh… the less well-off as slow as possible. I mean, this is, Red Cross is doing everything they can. We… we already realize a lot of the people that could help are at war, right now, fighting another way, and they’ve… they’ve given them permission to go down and shoot us.  [Mike Myers]: And subtle and but in even many ways more profoundly devastating is the lasting damage to the survivors’ will to rebuild and remain in the area. The destruction of the spirit of the people of Southern Louisiana and Mississippi may end up being the most tragic loss of all.  [Kanye West]: George Bush doesn’t care about black people.Kanye West|All Day|"  [Intro: Kanye West (Theophilus London)] All day, nigga (Dance, ayy, ayy ayy ayy)  [Hook 1: Kanye West] All day, nigga How long you niggas ball?

Channel cruiseKanye West|Barclays Visionary Stream of Consciousness|  I got off the phone with this one dude. I guess he used to run a multi-billion dollar company or something like that and he had some advice for me, right. He said, 'I don't approve of your methods in your interviews lately.' He said he only saw one person before who ever really pulled this off and that was Muhammad Ali. But he said if he could just give me some advice, he doesn't approve of the way I'm going about things as of late. And when anybody that's supposed to have a lot of money talks to me and they give me advice, I call that free advice, because they're trying to tell me what to do and they ain't cut no check yet. If I look to the side of me, or the other side of me, or if I look to the Internet or if I'm reading, and I don't see somebody that 36-years-old that made it this far with nobody that told they couldn't do it this much. Because the people that give me advice... I don't see them rocking for 15,000 motherfuckers in Brooklyn tonight. And I don't know if y'all have heard of [Nikola] Tesla, and I'm not talking about the car, I'm talking about the inventor. Or if y'all ever heard about [Alejandro] Jodorowsky, the director who made Holy Mountain. But there's so many amazing creative inventors who weren't recognized in their time. And if I've got the voice and I've got the opportunity to turn up in these interviews, I just have to look and say, 'What do I have to lose?' What do I have to lose? We only have everything to gain. So don't ever let them make you think for one moment that I'm going insane. Because I sit back and see shit and think 'Am I the only one that's not crazy?' But every celebrity is so goddamn scared of losing everything, that they won't ever say nothing to you. And y'all see that shit too. I gotta keep it so true for you... Because when I say 'creative genius,' I'm not saying that as a compliment to myself. I'm saying that because it's a burden to myself when these ideas keep me up at night. When you wanna give the world more and your ideas keep you up at night. When you wanna give the world so much more, so much more. And then nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. And nobody that runs Disney comes and sees this tour. They'd rather see the headline and be on some bullshit than to give me one little chance. Than to give me one little, little, little chance. Than to give me one little chance despite the advance out of Tesla's basement, despite the advance out of me saying Jodorowsky's name and ya'll don't know who the fuck he is when everybody copied off of him... And there's gonna be motherfuckers in this arena in a few months dancing all sloppy off of him...I love y'all so much you don't even understand. Because y'all help me to talk all this shit. Because when I be on the phone with these people that used to run companies and they're trying to tell me how to be me, y'all give me the power to talk my shit. And I swear to you, this is only the motherfucking beginning. And anybody who [says], 'Oh, he's the best of rap.' That's racist. And that's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing. That's pigeonholing and putting motherfuckers in a box. And putting creative niggas in a box. If you believe you can do anything, please raise your hands up tonight. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands in the sky. If you believe you can do anything, please put your hands so high. And I wish you could see my tears right now. Put your hands up high. I wish you could feel my pain right now. Cause these dreams keep me up at night. Cause these dreams keep me up at night. These dreams keep me up at night.

Yo, I done heard worse We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other To see which one'll swerve first Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets Kissed the cheek of the Devil Intelligence level is hellier than treble peakin' On speakers in the ghetto Dismissal, I'm not a fair man Disgraced the race of an atheist Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot One track sliced without swords I buried the Christ corpse, in my past life When the black knight mounted the white horse And stay over-worked It's like the Nazis and the Nation Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth  [Hook 1: Eminem] ‘Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal Above the law ‘cause I don't agree with police either (Shit, me neither)  [Verse 3: Eminem] We ain't eager to be legal So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle I breathe ether in three lethal amounts While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain (He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up And I'm pissed off, ‘cause I can't find a decent vein  [Verse 4: Royce da 5'9""] The disaster with dreads I'm bad enough to commit suicide And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead When in danger, it's funny Actually my flavor's similar to a waiter ‘Cause I serve any stranger with money I spray a hundred Man, until they joint chains, while slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches Piss on a flag and burn it Murder you then come to your funeral Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it Whippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass I'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt  [Spoken: Eminem] Hello? Ayo, what’s up? We’re coming to get you! Stop! THEY KNOW IT’S US!!!  [Verse 5: Eminem] I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? I'm the one who burned your house down, well, I'm out now And this time I'm comin' back to blow your house up And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe  [Hook 2: Royce da 5'9""] ‘Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel (We'll be waiting) See you in Hell Wall Street, Royce Da 5'9"", Slim Shady See you in Hell for the sequel (bye-bye) Bad Meets Evil, what ('til next time)  [Outro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)] And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil Two of the most wanted individuals in the county Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid Look like law-abiding citizens It's too bad they had to go out the way they did Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon But their spirits still live on 'til this day Shhh…  wait, did y'all hear that?

Are you trying to get through? Are you reaching out for me? And I'm reaching out for you  [Verse 1] I'm just so fuckin' depressed I just can't seem to get out this slump If I could just get over this hump But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump I took my bruises, took my lumps Fell down and I got right back up But I need that spark to get psyched back up In order for me to pick the mic back up I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in I'm starting to feel distant again So I decided just to pick this pen Up and try to make an attempt to vent But I just can't admit or come to grips with the fact That I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet And I know some shit's so hard to swallow But I just can't sit back and wallow In my own sorrow, but I know one fact: I'll be one tough act to follow, one tough act to follow I'll be one tough act to follow Here today, gone tomorrow But you'd have to walk a thousand miles  [Chorus] In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find, look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you  [Verse 2] I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor Everything's so tense and gloom I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature Of the room, just as soon as I walk in, it's like all eyes on me So I try to avoid any eye contact ‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door For conversation, like I want that I'm not lookin' for extra attention I just wanna be just like you Blend in with the rest of the room Maybe just point me to the closest restroom I don't need no fuckin' man-servant Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass Laugh at every single joke I crack And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha! Marshall, you're so funny, man You should be a comedian, goddamn!"" Unfortunately I am I just hide behind the tears of a clown So why don't you all sit down? Listen to the tale I'm about to tell Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles  [Chorus] In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find, look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you  [Verse 3] Nobody asked for life to deal us With these bullshit hands we're dealt We gotta take these cards ourselves And flip 'em, don't expect no help Now, I could've either just sat on my ass And pissed and moaned Or take this situation in which I'm placed in And get up and get my own I was never the type of kid To wait by the door and pack his bags And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed For a dad to show up who never did I just wanted to fit in in every single place Every school I went, I dreamed of being that cool kid Even if it meant acting stupid Aunt Edna always told me: ""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that"" Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk *like this* 'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole At eight years old; I learned my lesson then ‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo' But I already told you my whole life story Not just based on my description ‘Cause where you see it from, where you're sittin' It's probably 110% different I guess we would have to walk a mile In each other's shoes at least What size you wear? I wear 10s Let's see if you can fit your feet  [Chorus] In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find, look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you  [Bridge] Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own Everybody has a private world where they can be alone Are you calling me?
